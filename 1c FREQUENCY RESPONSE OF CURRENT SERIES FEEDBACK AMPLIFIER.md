### **Result**

Thus the current series  feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | f1 = 90 Hz | f1'' = 110 Hz |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | f2 = 400 KHz | f2'' = 109 KHz |
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl = 390 Hz) | \( BW = f'h - f'l = 10 KHz) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} = 18.31) | \( A'{v(mid)} = 17.19) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point | G0 = 14.31  | G0'' = 15.19 |


---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current series feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
