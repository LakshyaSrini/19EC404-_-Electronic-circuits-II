### **Result**

Thus the current shunt feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | f1 = 25 Hz | f1'' = 250 Hz |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | f2 = 170 KHz | f2'' = 450 KHz |
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl ) | \( BW = f'h - f'l = 447 KHz) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} = 26.51 dB) | \( A'{v(mid)} = 25.2 dB) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point | G0 = 23.5 | G0'' = 22.54 |

---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current shunt feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
